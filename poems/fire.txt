“Maureen, My Quiet Fire”

Maureen, your name alone feels like sunrise,
Soft light sneaking into a tired soul,
Warming the places life tried to freeze,
Whispering, “breathe… I’m here.”

Your smile? it melts stubborn worries,
Turns my chaos into calm,
Like honey dripping into tea,
Slow, sweet, steady.

Every night I miss your voice
That soft magic you throw without trying,
A tone that hugs the heart,
Even from miles away.

If love had footsteps,
Yours would echo in my chest,
Soft but sure,
Leading me straight to you.
