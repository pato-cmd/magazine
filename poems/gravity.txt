“Her Gravity”

Maureen, you pull me in
Without lifting a finger,
Like gravity choosing
Only my heart to command.

Your laugh is a spark
That lights the dullest hours,
Turning ordinary moments
Into quiet miracles.

I could search the world
For something sweeter,
But nothing compares
To the softness you carry.

If love had a center,
You’d be mine
Constant, steady,
Undeniably powerful.
