“Your Name in My Night”

When the night is long,
Your name walks through my thoughts
Like a candlelight
Soft but impossible to ignore.

Maureen, you make loving easy,
Like the heart already knows the script
And it’s just waiting
For you to speak.

I think of you,
And suddenly everything gets warmer,
Even the lonely parts of me
Start believing again.

If dreams had fingerprints,
Yours would be all over mine
Leaving traces,
Leaving sweetness,
Leaving you.
