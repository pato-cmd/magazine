“In the Quiet, It’s You”

Maureen, in every quiet moment,
Your name slips into my mind
Like a gentle breeze
Sneaking through an open window.

You’re the warmth
That sits behind my heartbeat,
The softness
That makes living feel lighter.

Sometimes I wonder
How one person
Can hold so much beauty
Without even trying.

But then I remember
It’s you.
You’ve always had that magic,
And my heart never stood a chance.
