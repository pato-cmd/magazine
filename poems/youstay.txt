“The Way You Stay”

Maureen, you’re the calm after storms,
The softness I run to
When the world starts shouting
My little peace.

Your kindness doesn’t scream,
It stays.
It wraps.
It heals.

Distance never dimmed you
If anything,
It sharpened every feeling
I’ve ever had for you.

And if love is choosing someone
Even on the toughest days,
Then Maureen,
I’m choosing you every time.
