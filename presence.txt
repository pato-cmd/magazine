“Her Presence”

Maureen, being yours is its own universe,
Where time walks slowly,
And affection feels effortless
Like breathing.

You talk, and suddenly I remember
Why the world feels worth trying again,
Why my heart still believes
In beautiful things.

Your laugh dances in my mind,
A rhythm I replay
Every time the day gets heavy
Or moments get dull.

If I could bottle your presence,
I’d keep it close to my pulse,
So even in silence,
I’d still feel you loving me.
